Thanks for dropping down to my blog. I hope you found my posts useful, please feel free to contact me on my twitter @sunilkumars6 or email me at pentestvizard@pm.me.

I am a Information security enthusiast, currently preparing to re-attempt my OSCP Exam in March 2020. I also occasionally solve CTF's on HTB and try to keep up with few others. OSCP preparation has taught me a lot of things besides the Mantra #tryHarder is #NeverGiveUp. 

Apart from that I am very curious about exploit development and binary exploitation.

And finally if you are looking for "How to hack Facebook" kinda of hacking articles, **Sorry!! this is not the right place**, its firstly not ethical and secondly I am not that kinda hacker you see in movies ! I am just a Penetration Tester.
