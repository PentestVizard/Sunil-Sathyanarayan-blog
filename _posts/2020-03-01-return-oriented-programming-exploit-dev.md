# **Return Oriented Programming - Exploit Implementation**

## 1. Abstract 

Return Oriented programming was surfaced first a decade ago, and was built to overcome the buffer exploit defence mechanisms like ASLR, DEP (or Wˆ X) by method of reusing the system code in the form of gadgets which are stitched together to make a Turing complete attack. And to perform Turing complete attack would require greater efforts which are quite complex, and there is very little research available for performing a Turing omplete attack. So, in this project, we are systemising the knowledge of the existing research that can be used to perform a Turing complete ROP attack.

## 2. Introduction 

Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is a technique by which an attacker can induce arbitrary behavior in a program by diverting the program control flow, without injecting any code. A return-oriented program chains together short instruction sequences already present in a programs address space, each of them ends in a return instruction. There are different ways to demonstrate ROP exploitation, one popular demonstration is to deactivate ASLR which is short form of Address Space Layout Randomization and it is a common defense for ROP attacks which works by randomly moving the segments of a program around in memory, preventing the attacker from predicting the address of useful gadgets. So, deactivating ASLR at the beginning of the implementation is a common demonstration. In this work, for our own simplicity, we tried to implement an attack on ROP by deactivating ASLR before implementing the exploit and writing our program. After ASLR deactivation, we implement our program in which a buffer overflow would occur by defining a function in our program which points to another function called function 1 and it also points to function 2 and so on which we explain more in section 5.

## 3. Related Work 

In order to find a way to exploit an attack in ROP, we went through some solutions against the attack such as G-free which is the only general solution as each defense method, rest of the mechanisms provide solutions to a specific built. We also found different methods to attack ROP such as ’Automated ROP’, ’ROP without return’ and Return-to-libc which we will summarize in the following subsections. In addition, we found various tools to find gadgets for performing ROP namely ’ROPgadget’ and’ROPeme’

### 3.1 G-Free

As [1], G-free is a compiler based approach against any possible form of ROP. It can eliminate all the unaligned free-branch instructions which are located inside an executable binary and protect them against attacker data misuse. This method provide an executable gadget-free solution which removes links between necessary chain sequence instructions that cannot be targeted by any possible ROP attack. In this solution, the first step is to eliminate any unaligned free-brunch instructions. The second step is to protect aligned free-brunch instructions to be secure against misuse. To achieve this goal, [1] employs two techniques: ret instructions to encrypt return address and a cookie-based technique to protect jmp*/call*. Ret instructions provides a short header and saved the encrypted return addresses into the stack. By this technique, whenever the attacker jump into a position of a function, he reaches the footer. As a result, these jumps transfer the attacker to an incorrect address that attacker cannot control.

### 3.2 Tools for finding Gadgets

In return oriented programming, the core idea is to get useful instruction sequences from the code and chain these instructions together. For this, the attacker should collect some useful sequence of instructions and then reuse these sequences as basic blocks to execute the code. The most important factor in ROP is that these collections of code provide a set of functionalities which allow the attacker to achieve touring completeness without any code injecting. In the next step, the attacker should chain these code sequences in an order to manipulate the program control flow.  Gadgets are these valid sequences of instructions to change the control flow satisfyingly [1]. In this section, we introduce some existing tools which enable us to find gadgets and chain them together.

## 4. Background 

ROP was built to overcome the shortcomings of Buffer overflow, where attacker was able to insert his arbitrary code in the stack segment and execute it, which was prevented by making the stack segment not executable and introducing ASLR made it more difficult for injection of malicious code. Hence ROP’s were built exploiting the existing defense mechanisms and reusing the code.

### 4.1 Buffer Overflow

In a buffer overflow attack, the attacker tries to overflow the stack by exceeding the limited length of the stack and modify the return address and points it to the address of his injected malicious code [4]. According to [7], buffer overflow attack exploits lack of array or buffer bound in compiler. In figure 1, a typical stack layout had been shown in which when a function had been called, how some stack entries like return address can be corrupted by a malicious copy operation.


## 5. Our Work 

Aim of this section is to demonstrate chaining of gadgets, so we wrote a simple buffer exploit from where we chained various types of functions viz., Functions with or without Parameters, and chaining of global functions and their respective behavior on stack which is the replication of actual gadgets in a general way but there are much of assembly coding involved while using gadgets. For this, we have referred blog posts published by various researchers[3][4][5].For the Implementation we used a 32-bit version of Debian based Linux Mint 18.1 operating system, and our exploit code was written in C program compiled with GCC complier, gdb for debugging, and extensively used objdump for finding addresses of chaining functions. Most modern Operating systems implement the randomizing the Address layout (ASLR) which makes difficult for a buffer exploit to execute since the code segment of stack is randomized preventing the attacker obtaining the return address of the functions, but for a 32 bit system attackers have often find a way to brute force. But for our work we considered disabling the ASLR manually
during the compilation time

g c c vuln . c −o vuln −fno−s t a c k −p r o t e c t o r

-fno-stack-protector disables the stack smashing protector thereby the addresses of the program are not randomized by the compiler, which enables us to control the code sequence. On the complied code we run objdump d vuln2 to obtain the exact memory addresses of the functions and to know the buffer length, and exploit the code sequence by overflowing the buffer and modifying the return addresses to arbitrary code snippets. Code Snippet below shows exploit code where we have induced a buffer overflow in the function echo() from where we will be executing arbitrary function and variables to demonstrate the chaining of gadgets in two phases: first phase with functions without argument and Second phase is functions with
arguments and global variables.
