# **Exploitation Implementation**

*In this article, You are going to learn about concepts related to performing Return oriented Programming exploitation, it will not be a walkthrough for the attack.*

**Prerequisties** : Understanding of Assembly level programming, Stackframe, buffer overflow concepts and ability to understanding python code. attack will be performed on Windows 10 Enterprise x86 VM running vulnserver. and for attacking Kali Linux VM is used.

## 1. What is Return Oriented Programming ?

Return Oriented programming or ROP is an exploitation technique used to bypass non-executable stack and code signing. for this to achieve it uses the method of reusing the system code in the form of gadgets which are stitched together to make a Turing complete attack. 

## Understanding the basics of ROP

In order to understand the ROP exploitation it is essential to understand buffer overflow or have a idea of buffer exploits.

### Understanding buffer overflows

A Buffer overflow occur when a program or process attempts to write more data to a fixed block of memory or buffer, than the buffer is allocated to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a defined amount of data, the extra data can overwrite data values in memory addresses adjacent to the destination buffer unless the program includes sufficient bounds checking to flag or discard data when too much is sent to a memory buffer.

### Stack Memory Protections 

Various Memory protection techniques that prevent execution of buffer overflow attacks
	
#### Stack Canaries 

Stack Canaries are a secret value placed on the stack which changes every time the program is started. Prior to a function return, the stack canary is checked and if it appears to be modified, the program exits immeadiately. 

This is a protection technique enabled at the GCC level.

#### DEP/NX 

#### ASLR

### Finding length of buffer and return address

### ROP Exploit with and without arguments
